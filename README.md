Physics student at UNAM (Facultad de Ciencias).  

Interests: Quantum Computing, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), Deep Learning and Scientific Machine Learning.

Profile: I am a Physics student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico with a focused interest in quantum
computing and machine learning. I am currently conducting research at the Advanced Digital Image Processing
Laboratory (LAPI), where I develop hybrid models that integrate neural networks with Quantum Machine
Learning techniques applied to image processing. My background combines theoretical physics, experimental
work, and a range of programming tools, allowing me to approach problems from an interdisciplinary
perspective.
